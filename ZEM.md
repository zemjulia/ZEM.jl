ZEM is an integrated open-source high-performance computational (HPC) framework for environmental management in [Julia](http://julialang.org).
ZEM includes a series of modules (FEHM, MySQL, etc.)
ZEM is coupled to use [Mads](http://mads.lanl.gov)

ZEM has been tested to perform HPC simulations on a wide-range multi-processor clusters and parallel environments (Moab, Slurm, etc.).
