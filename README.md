ZEM.jl: Framework for Management Groundwater Flow and Transport Models
=======================================

ZEM = Zeitgeist Environmental Management

ZEM is an integrated open-source high-performance computational (HPC) framework for environmental management in [Julia](http://julialang.org).

ZEM includes a series of modules (FEHM.jl, MySQL.jl, etc.)

ZEM is coupled to use [Mads](http://mads.lanl.gov) framework. [See also](http://madsjulia.github.io)

ZEM has been tested to perform HPC simulations on a wide-range multi-processor clusters and parallel environments (Moab, Slurm, etc.).
